## Leaflet Product Classification

This repository contains code for a multi-model approach to product classification using both image and text data. Below are the key components and findings of the project


### Key Findings:

#### Image Model:
<b> Top 5 accuracy: 97.08% <br>
Number of misclassified images: 653 </b>

#### Text Model:
Accuracy on misclassified images from the image model: 67.38%
Top 5 accuracy on misclassified images: 93.85%
Overall accuracy: 85.06%
Overall top 5 accuracy: 93.85%

#### Combined result:
<b> Overall accuracy: 97.44% </b>

### Conclusion:
The combination of image and text models provides a robust approach to product classification, leveraging both visual and textual information. While the image model achieved high accuracy, the text model helped improve classification performance, especially on misclassified images from the image model.
